Player Guide
************
- To start you'll need to find solar, lunar, pyro, and hydro crystal clusters. They need a diamond pickaxe or greater to mine.
(fortune increases drops)
	-Solar and lunar crystals spawn in "grassy" biomes, lunar being more rare. Lunar can also be found occasionally in the nether.
	-Pyro crystals spawn in desert and wasteland biomes and the nether.
	-Hydro crystals spawn in oceans and rivers.

- You can craft a Pedestal to display items with a quartz pillar, polished blackstone pressure plate, and 3 polished blackstone slabs.

- With the crystals you can craft a pure crystal using one of each in a crafting table.

- You can now make crystal tools and armor, which are better than netherrite. 

- Using a crystal tool or armor piece with a crystal of choice in a smithing table will infuse it with that crystal type.

- Solar tools and armor
	- When mining, all solar tools give you haste 1
	- Solar boots apply the speed 1 effect, and solar leggings apply jump-boost 2
	- When wearing a full set of solar armor, you gain speed 3 and jump-boost 4, and when mining with a solar tool you gain haste 3
- Lunar tools and armor
	- When holding any lunar tool, all mobs within a 50 block radius, not including players, will gain the glowing effect
	- Wearing the lunar helmet gives you night vision
	- when wearing a full set of lunar armor, and mob or player that deals damage to you will receive that x2
- Pyro tools and armor
	- All pyro tools will be enchanted with fire aspect when held 
	(if you'd like to enchant the tool in an enchanting table, make sure you don't hold it until you do)
	- Wearing any piece of pyro armor will give you fire resistance
	- When wearing a full set of pyro armor, any mobs attacking you will be set on fire for 5 seconds
- Hydro tools and armor
	- All hydro effects will only apply when in water or rain
	- When holding a hydro tool, you'll gain haste 25 (this negates the slow mining that comes from being in water)
	- When wearing a hydro chestplate you'll gain dophin's grace
	- A full set of hydro armor will give conduit power to all players and mobs within a 32 block radius including yourself

- All variants of crystals can be crafted in the stone cutter to get 2x crystal dust.

- Crafting with the 5 crystal dusts, you can create all 16 dyes.

- To craft a Divination Wand you'll need a couple sticks, a pure crystal, and the 4 other variants of crystals.

- To create the base rune, you'll need to have pure crystal dust in your offhand and right click a surface with the divination wand.

- Crafting with the base rune requires a specific order, right-click the ingredients onto the base rune and shift + right-click to craft.

- The storage rune is crafted with (in the specific order): chest, solar crystal, lunar crystal, pyro crystal, hydro crystal.
	- The storage rune is used to store items, it has the capacity of a normal chest. If you want to stop rendering the items, give the rune a redstone signal.

- The Crystalline Tablet is crafted with glass pane, solar crystal, lunar crystal, pyro crystal, hydro crystal.
	- You can shift + right-click a storage rune with the tablet to link it, then you can access that storage rune with the tablet as long as you're within 128 blocks.
